title: 'Module 3: Evidence-Based Nursing Practice'
description:
  'The notion of evidence-based (or evidence-informed) practice is well-established in nursing and in the health sciences in general. In Module 1 we will examine the evolution of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement, and different models for conceptualizing EBP. We will discuss both the purported benefits and the criticisms of the EBP movement in healthcare.'

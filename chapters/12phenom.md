<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

The focus of Week 12 is on phenomenology.  Phenomenology, as a way of understanding human experiences, has earned a well-deserved respect and credibility in health sciences research, specifically in nursing research. The learning objectives are:

- To develop an understanding of phenomenology as a qualitative research design and its aims and objectives, and situate it within its unique philosophical foundation.

-  To differentiate between different approaches to phenomenological research.

- To understand critical appraisal of phenomenological studies.

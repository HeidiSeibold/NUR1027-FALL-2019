<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

Following on from learning about how to conduct literature searches using electronic databases in the webinar last week, this week we have an opportunity to practice those skills in preparation for your assignment focusing on this essential requirement for using evidence to inform nursing practice. 

**The learning objectives are:**

- To become familiar with key sources of high quality evidence relevant for addressing nursing and health services practice questions.

-  To develop approaches for systematically and effectively searching bibliographic databases for high quality evidence to address practice questions .

<exercise id="2" title="First search">

In the next exercises, we'll be using the Pubmed database to search for research evidence. Everything entered within the quotations is just like entering a search on the Pubmed website.

The first time you enter your search by pressing the 'Submit' button, it will take a little while to load. If the search result hasn't returned after 1 minute - refresh the page. Each subsequent time you press 'Submit' the result will be returned much faster (unless it is idle for >10 minutes).

This first exercise is just a simple practice exercise to demonstrate the process and make sure everything is working right. Have a go at using a MeSH term in a search of the pubmed database. Search for the term 'nursing' and see how many results are returned.

Enter the term in place of the dotted line

<exercise id="3" title="Refining a search">

Now it's time to combine keywords to refine our results. Say we're interested in finding evidence for intentional rounding by nurses, but want to limit the search to less than 50 results. Add in one or more extra search terms combined with boolean operators (like AND, OR) to achieve this.

Enter a term in place of the dotted line. Try out some alternative tags like [TI] for just the title or [TIAB] for title and abstract.

<exercise id="5" title="Discussion board">

This week you will each practice implementing your search strategy in indexed databases. Using the search terms you identified in Week 3, conduct a search in CINAHL or Medline. Then, post a short description of your search within your assigned group on the discussion board:

- What is your search question?
- How did you combine search terms?
- How effective was your search in locating relevant articles? 
- If your search was not as effective as you anticipated, what strategies do you think would improve the search?
- What did you find (please keep this to 1-2 sentences for sharing the answer to your question)

**Remember to respond to one of your peerâ€™s posts!**

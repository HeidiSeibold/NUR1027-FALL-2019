<exercise id="2" title="Observational designs">


<qu>
Observational designs are used when a researcher wishes to construct a picture of a phenomenon or explore events, people or situations as they naturally occur in the environment. They aim to observe and identify variables of interest and explore relationships between those variables. 
</qu>


These designs are used when:
<ul>
<li><span>there is little information or research about the topic of interest, or</span></li>
<li><span>the phenomena of interest are not amenable to experimental designs (e.g. when ethical considerations do not allow a &lsquo;treatment&rsquo; to be denied to a control group).</span></li>
</ul>

Observational designs work from a clear, concise problem statement based within an appropriate theoretical framework. The common types of observational designs are discussed below.

- Quantitative description
- Correlational studies
- Cross-sectional studies
- Cohort studies
- Case-control studies


## Descriptive studies

Descriptive studies seek to describe the current status of a variable or phenomenon with no attempt to manipulate the conditions or events. Data for these studies is gathered through a number of ways including direct observations, questionnaires, and retrospective or prospective audit of available data. Descriptive studies can often be used as a precursor to other quantitative research. In a descriptive study, the researcher does not usually begin with a hypothesis, but one may be developed after the data is collected.

A survey is a common type of observational design that enables collection of information about the characteristics of particular individuals, groups, institutions or situations, or about the frequency of a phenomenon's occurrence, particularly when little is known about it. There are both advantages and disadvantages to consider when undertaking survey research. Variables of interest commonly investigate participants' knowledge, beliefs or attitudes about a particular topic or concept.

## Correlational studies

An extension of descriptive research are correlational studies which explore the relationships between variables to provide a deeper insight into the phenomenon of interest. These studies enable examination of the relationship between pairs of variables, as well as a comparison between groups. A researcher uses this design to quantify the strength of the relationship between variables (i.e. as one variable changes, does a related change occur in the other variable?). 

<qu>Correlational designs cannot test a &lsquo;cause-and-effect&rsquo; relationship (i.e. whether a change in one variable causes a measurable change in another variable). A common misuse of a correlational design is a researcher's attempt to conclude that a causal relationship exists between the study variables. When reading a correlational study, it is important to identify the variables and the relationship being tested, and consider whether the implied relationship is consistent with the conceptual framework and research question being asked. </qu>


### Case-control studies

A case-control study is an approach which examines participants on the basis of a study outcome (clinical characteristic, condition or disease) that *is* or *is not* present (e.g. delirium). The study direction is usually retrospective, from the study outcome backwards to the cause or the exposure. Individuals with the outcome of interest are the &lsquo;cases&rsquo;. Cases are matched with &lsquo;controls&rsquo;, a sample of people who come from the same &lsquo;study base&rsquo; (similar to the cases for characteristics such as age, gender or clinical procedure), but do not have the outcome of interest. Detailed past histories, particularly in relation to possible risk factors (exposure), are examined from both groups to see if the cases have been more exposed to the suspected causative factor than the controls.

Selection bias may exist if the cases are not from a well-defined study base (in time and place). A critical reader therefore needs to cautiously evaluate the conclusions drawn in relation to measurement error. Advantages are similar to those of a correlational design, but a higher level of control is possible. Disadvantages include an inability to draw a causal linkage between the two variables (an alternative hypothesis may cause the relationship), and finding naturally occurring groups of participants who are similar in all respects except for their exposure to the variable of interest is very difficult.


## Cross-sectional studies

Research that measures data at one point in time (i.e. data are collected on only one occasion with the same participants rather than on the same participants at several points in time) are called cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional studies vary from other descriptive studies because they use inferential statistics to infer a relationship between two or more variables. A limitation of the cross-sectional design is that the outcome of interest and the predictor variables being investigated are measured simultaneously. Thus, the effect of time on the outcome can not be accounted for. In contrast, a longitudinal study which follows a group of people for a period of time during a series of studies provides greater evidence of causality.

## Retrospective studies

Observational studies can be either retrospective or prospective. In a retrospective design, data is collected and recorded from previously occurring events; while in a prospective, or longitudinal design, data collection is planned and occurs after the study has begun.

<exercise id="3" title="Identify the research design">

Select the research design used by the study outlined below.

A case control study was used by a group of Australian nurse researchers to identify risk factors for incident delirium in patients admitted to hospital for acute medical care (Tomlinson et al 2016). An audit tool was used to review medical records of patients admitted to acute medical units for data regarding potential risk factors for delirium. Included in the study were 161 patients admitted to an acute medical ward and diagnosed **with** incident delirium as well as 321 patients sampled from the acute medical population admitted within the same time range, stratified for admission location but **without** a diagnosis of incident delirium during their admission. The researchers identified a selection of predisposing and precipitating risk factors. Predisposing risk factors included dementia, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, previous delirium and fracture on admission. Precipitating risk factors included the use of an indwelling catheter, adding more than three medications during admission and having an abnormal sodium level during admission.

<exercise id="6" title="Exercise">

Which of these statements is true?

<choice>

<opt text="Administration of an intervention to one group of participants and not another is an RCT">

Unless the participants are randomized to groups, it is not an RCT.

</opt>

<opt text="RCTs are always the best way to do a study">

It is true that properly conducted RCT's provide the best source of evidence to determine causal relationships, circumstances may arise where it is not practical to study a phenomenon using this design. 

</opt>

<opt text="A study using questionnaires with numerical scores to examine feelings, perceptions, social effects is a quantitative study" correct="TRUE">

</opt>

<opt text="When data are collected before and after the introduction of the intervention, the design is a case control study">

This description is more in line with a 'pre-test post-test' study design, which is a common design used in non-randomized studies of interventions. Case control studies are more 'natural' experiments, where patients who have an outcome of interest are compared to those who do not. It is typically a retrospective study design.

<exercise id="2" title="Ontology">

If a researcher decides to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine if a nurse-led psychosocial intervention decreases symptoms of depression after stroke, what ontology has informed their view of reality? 

<choice>

<opt text="Relativism">

Relativistis believe that multiple realities exist that need to be interpreted. This is not aligned with the RCT design, that uses objective measurements with the main aim being 'generalization'.

</opt>

<opt text="Realism" correct="TRUE">
Although you will never read a statement about the researcher's 'ontology' in the methods section of an RCT, the fact that this design was chosen implies that researchers are indeed aligned with a 'realist' ontology. Great work! Now - on to epistemology:sunglasses:

# Positivism/Postpositivism Paradigms
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ontology**|View of the world is that there is one single objective external reality, which can be measured and known.|
|   |Empirically observable elements/events through the human senses/ value-free [postpositivists’ believe reality is never fully apprehended]|
|**Epistemology**|Observable and measurable facts|
|**Research methodology**|Quantitative approach would be used to explain or predict (using quantitative study designs) to generate new knowledge via deductive logical reasoning/hypotheses testing|
|   |Data collection - concepts are operationalized/measured (e.g., questionnaires; physiological measures)|
|   |Statistical analysis focuses on generalization|

# Interpretivist/Constructivist Paradigm
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Relativist ontology**| Reality is constructed through the meanings and understandings developed from subjective experiences of individuals/ interactive dialogue<br> Multiple realities (that need to be interpreted)<br><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Reality is socially constructed and dynamic<br>Subjective reality|
|**Epistemology**|We cannot separate ourselves from what we know; knowledge is co-constructed/socially constructed; inductive reasoning|
|**Research methodology**|Qualitative approach- naturalistic inquiry (e.g., phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography); data collection- e.g., interviews, observations; data analysis- e.g., content/thematic analysis; unique/dynamic understanding of the phenomenon|

# Critical Social Paradigm

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Ontology** | Reality is created and shaped by social, political, cultural, economic, ethnic and/or gender-based/feminists factors|
| **Epistemology** | We cannot separate ourselves from what we know; critique of social conditions for the purpose of creating change; uncover power relationships/empower the oppressed|
|**Research Methodology**| Qualitative or mixed methods research approach; examine social conditions; goal is to change the situation/system (e.g., social change/ change inequities); emancipatory research/action research|

<exercise id="13" title="Discussion">


In this week’s readings, you have encountered the different ways major approaches to research have been categorized (e.g., Monti &  Tingen, and Long & Dunphy).

- Reflecting on your clinical and/or research experiences, how would you describe your own epistemological, ontological, and methodological assumptions? Think about which of the approaches we have explored is/are closest to your own assumptions about truth, knowledge, and the nature of reality.
- Think back to the practice question you developed in Week 3. Which paradigm does your question fit into? Why?

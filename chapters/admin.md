<exercise id="2" title="Course description">

A major responsibility for masters-prepared advanced practiced nurses in leadership roles (formal or informal) is promoting evidence-informed practice and policy decisions within nursing. In order to be successful in this endeavour, nurses must be knowledgeable consumers of nursing and related (e.g. health services and social sciences) research. This course and the subsequent course NUR 1127H will further develop your knowledge, skill, and judgment related to research competencies for advanced practice nurses as outlined in the Canadian Nurses’ Association document “Advanced Practice Nursing: A Pan-Canadian Framework (2019)”. The focus of NUR 1027H is on critical examination and reflection on research and evidence-informed practice, with an emphasis on integration of theory and research to guide practice. You will develop an understanding of the philosophical foundations of contemporary approaches to knowledge production in nursing and the health sciences, and essential competencies in locating, interpreting, critiquing, and using research evidence in practice. Critical analysis of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and their underlying theoretical frameworks will enable you to understand and appropriately integrate research into practice.

</exercise>

<exercise id="3" title="Course objectives">

*The overall objectives of the course are to enable students to:*

- Appreciate the integral role of research evidence in informing nursing practice.

2. Understand the development of major approaches to knowledge production in the health sciences (philosophy of science.)

3. Situate qualitative and quantitative modes of inquiry within their respective ontological and epistemological foundations.

4. Understand the relationship between the philosophical foundations of different research designs and approaches, and apply criteria for assessing rigour (truth value) of these designs and approaches.

5. Cultivate a sensitivity to, and appreciation of, the complexity and diversity of nursing research approaches relevant to leadership and health services.

*Specifically, students will develop the ability to:*
- Critically appraise and use frameworks and strategies to support evidence-informed practice and knowledge translation.

2. Formulate clear, specific questions about health care practice that can be addressed with research evidence.

3. Plan and execute a systematic search to locate evidence to answer practice questions.

4. Critically appraise and interpret descriptive research studies that employ different approaches.

<exercise id="7" title="Discussion group">

Participation in an asynchronous discussion group, found by clicking on "Discussions" in Quercus will give you an opportunity for further clarification and commentary on the key concepts and learning activities, through dialogue with your classmates, professor and teaching assistant. It is expected that students will regularly respond to questions and comments posed on the discussion board, and that posts will develop increasing depth and sophistication as the course progresses.

</exercise>

<exercise id="8" title="Online activities">

In addition to independent learning activities, there will be regular online group activities designed to create learning synergies, extend your critical thinking about the course material, and build a sense of community among students. 

</exercise>

<exercise id="9" title="Working in an online environment">

How do I work and learn in an online environment?
The online environment provides increased flexibility in terms of when and where you engage in learning activities. However it can also present challenges, requiring a degree of self-discipline to ensure you are able to take advantage of group discussions and learn from the observations and insights of your colleagues, as well as the course faculty. Here are some tips to help you be successful in engaging in on-line learning:
•	This is a relatively self-directed learning environment, so it is important to manage your time carefully.
•	As is the case in all graduate programs (both in-class and on-line), the course requires a considerable amount of independent study, guided by modules that contain resources and learning activities for one or more weeks. Be sure to complete the weekly learning activities, and to participate in the Discussion every week. This is where we will work through together any questions you have about the material you are studying.
•	Organize your time to ensure that you can complete the weekly reading and other learning activities on time. It is critical that you do not get behind. 
•	While completing the weekly learning activities, compile a list of questions or concerns that arise so that you can seek help via your colleagues on the discussion board.

</exercise>

<exercise id="10" title="Course time commitment">

Most students will need a **minimum 8-10 hours/week** to complete the readings and learnings activities and participate in the discussion group.  **Additional time** will be required to complete assignments.

</exercise>

<exercise id="11" title="Writing resources">

We strongly recommend a visit to the [University of Toronto Writing Centre Website](http://writing.utoronto.ca/). This website has a wealth of information regarding academic writing including information about writing when English is not your first language, writing courses and workshops available for students, and information about using other Writing Centres at the University of Toronto. The “Writing Advice” tab contains a host of online writing support resources. Sample topics include: preparing an outline, revising an essay, developing coherent paragraphs, style and editing, grammar and punctuation, etc.

If your contact information changes, please notify the MN Graduate and Curriculum Assistant (academic.nursing@utoronto.ca) and update ACORN immediately.  

Quercus will be used to post the course syllabus, recorded lectures, weekly readings and other learning activities, and important announcements.  Click [here](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670) for Quercus information and resources.

Please also use our course Quercus site Discussion section to ask questions about class content and assignments.  Many of you will have similar questions and we can ensure consistent responses to your concerns by using Quercus.  We (the Teaching Assistant or I) will read and respond to Quercus postings and messages and our Discussions (via Quercus and Voicethread) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays by 5 pm.  E-mail communication with either the Professor or the TA should be used only for purposes other than asking questions about course content (e.g., for scheduling a one-to-one appointment) or for communication of a personal nature.  

Forwarding your utoronto.ca email to a Hotmail or Yahoo or other type of email account is not advisable. In some cases, messages from utoronto.ca addresses sent to Hotmail or Yahoo accounts are filtered as junk mail, which means that emails from your course instructor may end up in your spam or junk mail folder. 

</exercise>

<exercise id="15" title="Technical requirements">

There are technical requirements that will allow you to participate in the course. The course includes online webinars and assignments that are submitted online.
 
*Minimum Computer System Requirements*

- Laptop or Desktop
- 2GB Ram
- 3.0 GHz Single Core Processor
- Windows 7 or Mac OSX 10.9
- Webcam with at least 640 x 480 resolutions
- Headphones
- Microphone (Built-in, on headphones, or external)
 
As a general rule, if you have purchased your computer within the last 3-5 years you will likely have no trouble meeting these requirements.  If your computer does not meet the minimum requirements you may have difficulty using some of the applications.
 
 Most new laptops (within 3-5 years) have webcams built in. If you are using a desktop computer you may need to purchase a webcam. In addition, you will need a microphone (most webcams and laptops have built-in microphones) and a set of headphones such as the kind that come with mobile devices and smartphones.
 
In addition to the computer system requirements it is also recommended you have sufficiently fast Internet. Ensure you have DSL or Cable Internet with at least 1.5 Mbps download speed and at least 1.5 Mbps upload speed. Dial-up Internet is not sufficient and is not recommended.
 
You can test your Internet speed by going to ww.speedtest.net and clicking the “Begin” button.
 
In addition it is important to note that some computer applications may be required to communicate throughout this course.  Ensure you have the latest versions of:
 
o	[Acrobat Reader, Flash Player, and Shockwave](https://www.adobe.com)
o	[Java](http://www.java.com/en/)
o	Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explore, and/or Safari (we recommend having two browsers installed just in case you run into issues with one of them)
 
Please note: If you are accessing the Internet through a large organization (e.g. a hospital) you may need to contact your organization’s IT department to arrange these downloads and confirm internet speed.
 
Please note, the university also provides free [antivirus software](http://antivirus.utoronto.ca/index.php?page=students ) to all students which is strongly recommended.


</exercise>

<exercise id="16" title="Course participation">

The Quercus Discussion Board and Voicethread is our virtual classroom. This is where we will engage in discussion and clarification of the course material, and practise applying course concepts. In order to make the most of this opportunity, we need to allow time for these asynchronous discussions to unfold over the week. Thus it is important that you go join the discussions several times over the week, rather than posting only at the end of the week.
To facilitate discussion there will be a number of questions posed each week. It is important that all students participate in these discussions. I ask that you please keep your postings succinct **(maximum 200 words (text) or 2 minutes audio/video)** so that others have an opportunity to respond as well. Postings must be presented in your own words and reflect a critical analysis and interpretation of course material, exercises, and other learning activities.  You are encouraged to share insights into the application and use of course concepts in practice. Please include relevant references in your posts (not included in the word count).
Students are expected to read assigned material for each week and respond to each other’s postings and questions.  The minimum expectation is that you submit one posting of your own and provide a short but substantive response to at least one other student’s post each week.


*Relevance and Content*

The student:
-	Comments and questions and thoughtfully addresses the topic and question.
-	Demonstrates s/he has read the discussion and has taken the discussion into consideration before posting.
-	Contributes new ideas (e.g., new perspectives, examples) in integrating relevant readings.
-	Makes connections between ideas (e.g., connects concepts, explains similarities).
-	Applies and rephrases ideas from previous classes accurately and appropriately.
-	Asks questions that promote in-depth discussion.

*Tone and Clarity*
-	Tone is respectful, friendly and professional.
-	Proofreads comments for clarity before posting.
-	Communicates ideas in a professional but engaging way.
-	Addresses other students by name.
-	Humour, emotions, and colloquial language, if used at all, are used sparingly and with sensitivity to other students.
-	Responds to other students as well as the instructor.

*Netiquette*
Certain rules of etiquette are also recommended for online discussions (Netiquette). These include:
- Always be courteous to other students
- Before introducing a new topic area, search to see if a similar discussion point already exists
- Stay on-topic
- Avoid the use of all CAPTIAL LETTERS in posts. ALL CAPS is considered shouting

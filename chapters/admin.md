<exercise id="2" title="Course description">

A major responsibility for masters-prepared advanced practiced nurses in leadership roles (formal or informal) is promoting evidence-informed practice and policy decisions within nursing. In order to be successful in this endeavour, nurses must be knowledgeable consumers of nursing and related (e.g. health services and social sciences) research. This course and the subsequent course NUR 1127H will further develop your knowledge, skill, and judgment related to research competencies for advanced practice nurses as outlined in the Canadian Nurses’ Association document “Advanced Nursing Practice: A National Framework (2008)”. The focus of NUR 1027H is on critical examination and reflection on research and evidence-informed practice, with an emphasis on integration of theory and research to guide practice. You will develop an understanding of the philosophical foundations of contemporary approaches to knowledge production in nursing and the health sciences, and essential competencies in locating, interpreting, critiquing, and using research evidence in practice. Critical analysis of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and their underlying theoretical frameworks will enable you to understand and appropriately integrate research into practice.

<exercise id="3" title="Course objectives">

*The overall objectives of the course are to enable students to:*

- Appreciate the integral role of research evidence in informing nursing practice.

2. Understand the development of major approaches to knowledge production in the health sciences (philosophy of science.)

3. Situate qualitative and quantitative modes of inquiry within their respective ontological and epistemological foundations.

4. Understand the relationship between the philosophical foundations of different research designs and approaches, and apply criteria for assessing rigour (truth value) of these designs and approaches.

5. Cultivate a sensitivity to, and appreciation of, the complexity and diversity of nursing research approaches relevant to leadership and health services.

*Specifically, students will develop the ability to:*
- Critically appraise and use frameworks and strategies to support evidence-informed practice and knowledge translation.

2. Formulate clear, specific questions about health care practice that can be addressed with research evidence.

3. Plan and execute a systematic search to locate evidence to answer practice questions.

4. Critically appraise and interpret descriptive research studies that employ different approaches.

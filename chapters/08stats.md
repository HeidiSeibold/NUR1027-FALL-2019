<codeblock id="08_01">

Enter the number of coin flips you want to simulate in the first argument and the probability of it being heads (as a proportion - eg 0.5 for 50% probability) as the third argument.

<exercise id="4" title="Cumulative Density Exercise">

There is about a 15% chance that if you tried flipping ten coins that each had a 30% probability of heads, at least five would turn up heads. 

Run the code below, inspect the results and then answer the questions below.

Run the code, inspect the results then answer the question.

Did you need all 10,000 trials to get an accurate answer?

<choice>

<opt text="No">

100 simulations produced a fairly different result - 17% instead of 15%. It really depends on how close to the truth we need to get. A 2% difference may not be all that important to our decision-making in this situation, but in other situations, for example in studies of mortality, a 2% difference may be very important. 

</opt>

<opt text="Yes" correct="TRUE">

Using only 100 simulations produced a fairly different result - 17% instead of 15%.

<exercise id="24" title="Discussion">

This week we continue with our critical appraisal of the Curtis & Glacken (2014) article.

Each student is asked to respond to one of the following questions. Some of you may discuss the same question, but please ensure all questions are addressed.

- Were the data analysis procedures clearly described and appropriate for the type of data collected?
- Were the results presented in a clear and understandable format? (e.g., tables, etc).
- What were the study results? Did the results address the study purpose and research questions?
- What does this study contribute to our knowledge? How does it extend or connect with what we already know?
- How are the results relevant to practice in your context?
- Were the identified implications for practice appropriate, based on the study findings?
- Did the study have weaknesses not identified by the researcher?

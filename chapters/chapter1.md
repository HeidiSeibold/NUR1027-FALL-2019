title: 'Module 1: Evidence-Based Nursing Practice'
description:
  'The notion of evidence-based (or evidence-informed) practice is well-established in nursing and in the health sciences in general. In Module 1 we will examine the evolution of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement, and different models for conceptualizing EBP. We will discuss both the purported benefits and the criticisms of the EBP movement in healthcare.'

<exercise id="3" title="First search">

<exercise id="4" title="Refining a search">

Now it's time to combine keywords to refine our results. Say we're interested in finding evidence for intentional rounding by nurses, but want to limit the search to less than 50 results. Add in one or more extra search terms combined with boolean operators (like AND, OR) to achieve this.

<codeblock id="01_04">

Enter a term in place of the dotted line. Try out some alternative tags like [TI] for just the title or [TIAB] for title and abstract.

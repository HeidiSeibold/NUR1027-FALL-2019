title: 'Week 1: Evidence-Based Practice'
description:
  'The notion of evidence-based (or evidence-informed) practice is well-established in nursing and in the health sciences in general. In Module 1 we will examine the evolution of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement, and different models for conceptualizing EBP. We will discuss both the purported benefits and the criticisms of the EBP movement in healthcare.'

Whats is the major difference between the two different EBP models presented above?<br><br>
<choice>
<opt text="One model values patient-centred care more than clinical expertise" correct="true">

Good job! It is clear the Rycroft-Malone model is focused on the outcome of achieving  patient-centered care by explictly stating this outcome in the center of the model. In contrast, 'clinical expertise' is seen as the core element unifying the other components of achieving evidence-based clinical decisions in the other model.

<opt text="Health care resources are not considered in both models">

This is one of the differences, however, what is different at the 'core' (center) of these two different models, suggesting it as the component of most value to the model?

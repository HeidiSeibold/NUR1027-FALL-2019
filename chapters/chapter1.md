title: 'Module 1: Evidence-informed Nursing Practice'
description:
  'The notion of evidence-based (or evidence-informed) practice is well-established in nursing and in the health sciences in general. In Module 1 we will examine the evolution of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement, and different models for conceptualizing EBP. We will discuss both the purported benefits and the criticisms of the EBP movement in healthcare.'

<exercise id="3" title="First search">

<exercise id="4" title="Refining a search">

Now it's time to combine keywords to refine our results. Say we're interested in finding the evidence for intentional rounding by nurses, but want to limit the results of our search to less than 500 results. Add in some extra search terms combined with boolean operators (like AND, OR) to achieve this.

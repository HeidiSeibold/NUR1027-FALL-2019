title: 'Week 1: Evidence-Based Practice'
description:
  'The notion of evidence-based (or evidence-informed) practice is well-established in nursing and in the health sciences in general. In Module 1 we will examine the evolution of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement, and different models for conceptualizing EBP. We will discuss both the purported benefits and the criticisms of the EBP movement in healthcare.'

Whats is the major difference between the two different EBP models presented above?<br><br>
<choice>
<opt text="One model values patient-centred care more than clinical expertise" correct="true">

Good job! It is clear the Rycroft-Malone model is heavily focused on the outcome of achieving  patient-centered care by explictly stating this outcome in the center of the model. In contrast, 'clinical expertise' is seen as the core element unifying the other components of achieving evidence-based clinical decisions in the other model.

<opt text="Health care resources are not considered in both models">

This is one of the differences, however, what is different at the 'core' (center) of these two different models, suggesting it as the component of most value to the model?

<exercise id="6" title="What constitutes 'good' research evidence?">



Nurses must be knowledgeable consumers of research in order to use evidence effectively to guide practice.


**Methodological quality**

How research is conducted influences the conclusions we can draw from it.

**Clinical and contextual relevance**

<exercise id="7" title="Why do we need evidence-based practice?">

An abundance of research has been undertaken to evaluate the effects of using evidence-based practice. In general, the benefits of evidence-based practice include that patient

A landmark <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa022615" >study</a> in the US by Elizabeth McGlynn and colleagues (2003) revealed that:
- Patients received only 55% of recommended care;
- Range in getting the right care varies according to medical condition; and
- 20 â€“ 30% of patients received unnecessary/harmful care.

Substantial progress has been made in ensuring that health professionals are capable users of evidence in their practice.  Recently, a consensus statement on core competencies in evidence-based practice for health professionals were developed.

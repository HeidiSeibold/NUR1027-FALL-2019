title: 'Week 1: Evidence-Based Practice'
description:
  'The notion of evidence-based (or evidence-informed) practice is well-established in nursing and in the health sciences in general. In Module 1 we will examine the evolution of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement, and different models for conceptualizing EBP. We will discuss both the purported benefits and the criticisms of the EBP movement in healthcare.'

Whats is the major difference between the two different EBP models presented above?<br><br>
<choice>
<opt text="One model values patient-centred care more than clinical expertise" correct="true">

Good job! It is clear the Rycroft-Malone model is heavily focused on the outcome of achieving  patient-centered care by explictly stating this outcome in the center of the model. In contrast, 'clinical expertise' is seen as the core element unifying the other components of achieving evidence-based clinical decisions in the other model.

<opt text="Health care resources are not considered in both models">

This is one of the differences, however, what is different at the 'core' (center) of these two different models, suggesting it as the component of most value to the model?

<exercise id="6" title="What constitutes 'good' research evidence?">

Although evidence-based practice must consider sources outside of research evidence to inform decision-making, nurses must still be knowledgeable consumers of research in order to use evidence effectively to guide practice. Central to this is the understanding that different types of research designs are appropriate for different research question. For example, in most cases, the most rigorous research design to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of an intervention is the randomized controlled trial design. Other research designs are more appropriate to use when the research question instead focuses on, for example, exploring the lived experience of patients with a specific disease or condition. This concept can be broadly referred to as clinical and contextual relevance. Many critical appraisal tools contain items that draw clinician's attention to the clinical and contextual relevance of the piece of research being evaluated. For example, section C of the <a href="https://casp-uk.net/casp-tools-checklists/">CASP</a> (Crticial Appraisal Skills Program) suite of tools pictured below asks the question, *'Will the results help locally?'*.

**Methodological quality**

Another core component in deciding what constitutes 'good' research evidence concerns _how_ research is conducted. The way in which research is conducted has a great influence on the conclusions we can draw from it. As we touched on earlier, evidence hierarchies seldom tell the whole story. A systematic review that combined the results of many small randomized controlled trials, which each had limitations in the way they carried out important elements of study procedures such as the randomization procedure and concealment of assigned interventions from participants and outcome assesors, would not provide as important information as a, rigorously conducted single randomized controlled trial - despite the fact that it is 'lower' down on an evidence hierarchy such as that pictured below.

Later in the course, we'll be going into far greater detail about the methodological aspects of different research designs that are important to consider when deciding about the quality of research evidence that is available to inform decision-making as one component of the evidence-based practice framework.

<exercise id="7" title="Why do we need evidence-based practice?">

An abundance of research has been undertaken to evaluate the effects of using evidence-based practice. In general, the benefits of evidence-based practice include that patients have better outcomes, the practitioner can have an increased sense of confidence that their decisions and actions are based on sound rationale and evidence
- Professional accountability and justification of actions
- Basis for team collaboration regarding plan of care
- Empowerment of patients and families

A landmark <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa022615" >study</a> in the US by Elizabeth McGlynn and colleagues (2003) revealed that:
- Patients received only 55% of recommended care;
- Range in getting the right care varies according to medical condition; and
- 20 â€“ 30% of patients received unnecessary/harmful care.

Substantial progress has been made in ensuring that health professionals are capable users of evidence in their practice.  Recently, a consensus statement on core competencies in evidence-based practice for health professionals were developed.

<exercise id="3" title="First search">

In the next exercises, we'll be using the Pubmed database to search for research evidence. Everything entered within the quotations is just like entering a search on the Pubmed website.

The first time you enter your search by pressing the 'Submit' button, it will take a little while to load. If the search result hasn't returned after 1 minute - refresh the page. Each subsequent time you press 'Submit' the result will be returned much faster (unless it is idle for >10 minutes).

This first exercise is just a simple practice exercise to demonstrate the process and make sure everything is working right. Have a go at using a MeSH term in a search of the pubmed database. Search for the term 'nursing' and see how many results are returned.

<exercise id="4" title="Refining a search">

Now it's time to combine keywords to refine our results. Say we're interested in finding evidence for intentional rounding by nurses, but want to limit the search to less than 50 results. Add in one or more extra search terms combined with boolean operators (like AND, OR) to achieve this.

<codeblock id="01_04">

Enter a term in place of the dotted line. Try out some alternative tags like [TI] for just the title or [TIAB] for title and abstract.

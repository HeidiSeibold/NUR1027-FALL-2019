Now we've established that knowledge translation is very much a process that involves multiple phases that really should be on-going for any change to be sustainable. A substantial portion of the literature in knowledge translation has focused on one of the most important steps in the process, and that is the actual implementation of the intervention - or in simpler terms - how the knowledge is translated into practice.

This table summarizes the effects of some of the different knowledge translation strategies that have been used to change the practice of healthcare professionals. And it's really important to learn from what we know. So for example, we know with a high degree of certainty that the simple provision of printed educational materials about some sort of new knowledge is not going to exert a considerable impact on clinicians' behaviours. This is really a passive dissemination technique that should only be used in combination with some other more interactive and engaging implementation strategy. So based on the information we have at hand in the table here, it would appear that local opinion leaders are one of the most effective strategies. But we should also note that multi-component implementation strategies combining several of these techniques could be even more effective.

Next up is a great discussion paper for you to read that addresses some important questions like:

What knowledge should be translated?
Who should research knowledge be translated to?
Who should be actually translating the knowledge?
How should the research knowledge be translated?
And what effect should the translation of knowledge actually have?

The bulk of this article focuses mostly on providing a good overview of the effectiveness of different strategies for knowledge transfer. And they conclude that there is good evidence to suggest that it is possible to achieve important changes in healtcare professionals' practice with current knowledge translation activities.

We can define measurement as the process of observing and recording. To do that you generally require some sort of instrument or tool. Consider for example a ruler. It's a tool we use to measure height or length. Measuring something like nurses' intentions to stay working in the acute care setting is a little more complext than measuring height though. So we need to be able to check if the tool or instrument we're going to use to measure these complext constructs is reliable and valid.

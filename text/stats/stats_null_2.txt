First, we take the data from our sample and specify that we are interested in the relationship between leadership and whether or not nurses have a masters degree. We then state our null hypothesis that there is no difference in leadership scores between groups - in other words they are independent. Then, we generate 1 random shuffle of the data and calculate the difference in mean leadership scores between the masters and bachelors degree groups. We can then plot the results. In the plot the x - or horizontal - axis is the difference in mean leadership score between groups. We can see the result from our sample of 200 nurses on the right hand side - meaning that the mean leadership score was higher in the nurses who had masters degrees in this sample. In this first random shuffle we produce on our way to constructing a null distribution, just like in our sample, the mean leadership score was higher in the Masters group. Let's do another random shuffle. 

This time, the Masters degree nurses had a mean leadership score lower than the bachelors group. To build up the null distribution, we simply take lots and lots of random shuffles. Let's do one thousand of them and take a look at the null distribution.

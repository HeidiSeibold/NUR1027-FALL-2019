In the last video, we constructed a null distribution to help us test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in leadership score between nurses who do or do not have a masters degree. Here it is here again. What we can do now, is go ahead and calculate a p-value using this null distribution. A P value is the probability of an event occurring that is as, or more, extreme than what we observed in our sample, ASSUMING the null hypothesis is true. Remember, our null hypothesis was that there is NO DIFFERENCE in leadership score between groups. Caclulating a p-value is actually really easy.

In fact, we could just run this one line of code and get the computer to spit out the answer in less than a second. In our case, the p-value turns out to be point zero two two. But I know what you're thinking - what is that supposed to mean! So let's instead take things a little slower and go through with some visualizations to demonstrate what's actually going on so you will know how to to interpret pvalues correctly when you come across them reported in research papers. First things first, in our sample the difference in mean leadership scores between groups was one point eight. Let's add that in to the plot of the null distribution as a red line.

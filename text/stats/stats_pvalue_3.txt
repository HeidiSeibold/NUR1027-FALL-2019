But what can we conclude from this p-value now that we've calculated it and know what it means. First we should remember back to earlier in this series of videos when we established that the GOAL of hypothesis testing for statistical inference was to disprove the null hypothesis. And I'm sure you would have all seen or heard p-values lower than the traditional benchmark of point zero five as being considered statistically significant. So what we have done by calculating this p-value is we have established some pretty compelling evidence against the null hypothesis. That there was only about a two percent probability of observing a result as or more extreme than the one point eight difference in mean score between groups in our sample strongly suggests that the null hypothesis is not true. 

In statistical terms, we would say that based on these results, we should therefore REJECT the null hypothesis that there was no difference in leadership scores between groups and hence we accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference in leadership between masters and bachelors degree prepared nurses. 

Just as a final note, p-values are a bit notorious for being misinterpreted. So I hope this series of videos where I have taken you through the process of simulating a null distribution and comparing that to our observed data has helped you to understand exactly what a p-value is testing. In the next section I've set up an exercise for you to practice statistical inference using a hypothesis testing framework.

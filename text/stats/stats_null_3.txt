This is our null distribution. Each dot represents a mean difference in leadership score from a hypothetical sample of 200 nurses where there is no association between the leadership score and whether or not the nurses have a masters degree. What we see when we have completely built the null distribution is that the mean differences in leadership scores were between about negative two and positive two, although the majority of differences were between negative one and positive one. In other words, if we assume the null hypothesis is true, and remember, our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in leadership score between groups, it would be totally expected that if we drew lots of samples of 200 nurses from the population the average difference in leadership score between groups that we would observe would fall between one point higher or one point lower in the masters group most of the time. The solid red line in the plot is the mean difference in leadership score between groups that we ACTUALLY observed in our sample. The Masters nurses scored their leadership capabilities one point eight points higher on average than nurses with baachelors degrees. So what we can tell already, is that the observed mean difference in leadership capability in OUR sample does seem a bit extreme compared to this collection of differences from the null distribution. 

In the next video, I'll move on to demonstrating how we can calculate a p-value using this null distribution and the mean difference in leadership score that we observed in our sample.

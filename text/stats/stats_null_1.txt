In this video, we're going to build a null distribution so you can get your head around what a p-value is and how we can use that information to inform our decision as to whether we should accept or reject a null hypothesis. First, let's get our sample from the population. 

We have here the leadership capability scores from a sample of two hundred nurses. The leadership capability scores range from 0 to 15, with higher scores meaning greater leadership capability. In our sample, one hundred of the nurses have a masters degree and the other hundred have a bachelors degree. In the sample, the mean leadership capability score for the nurses with a masters degree was eight point six and for the nurses with a bachelors degree it was six point eight. Something to take note of here is that the difference in means between the two groups in our sample was about one point eight points.

Now that we have our sample from the population, we can use simulations to build a distribution of differences in means, assuming the null hypothesis that there is no difference in leadership scores between the two groups is true. This is called a null distribution. The null distribution we are building consists of randomly shuffled differences in 200 leadership scores, so that the samples don't have any dependency between leadership scores and whether or not nurses have a masters degree. Let's step through how a null distribution is produced to make it easier to understand.

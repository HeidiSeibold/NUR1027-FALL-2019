Then, to get the p-value we have to work out how many times out of the one thousand random shuffles that made up the null distribution that the difference in means was more extreme than one point eight. Something to note here is that because we didn't specify a direction for our null hypothesis, we just simply stated that the difference in means between nurses with and without a masters degree would be zero, the p-value takes into consideration values that were more extreme than what we observed from both sides of the curve - so both positive one point eight and negative one point eight. Let's shade this area on the null distribution now. 

As it turns out, in only 22 out of the 1000 random shuffles that made up the null distribution did the difference in leadership score means turn out to be as or more extreme than the one point eight we observed in our sample.

And that, my friends, is where our p-value came from. Twenty two divided by one thousand is point zero two two. Another way of looking at this is that there is a two point two percent probability of observing an event as or more extreme than the one we observed in our sample of nurses ASSUMING the null hypothesis is true.

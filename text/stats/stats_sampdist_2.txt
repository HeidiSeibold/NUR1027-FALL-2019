To demonstrate the point that larger samples provide better estimates of the target population, we can explore what happens if we redo this sampling experiment, but this time sampling five hundred nurses instead of fifty, before taking the mean each time, and repeating this until one thousand sample mean values have been recorded. For completeness, letâ€™s also do the same with samples of just five nurses each. We compare the resulting sampling distributions from all three scenarios here, with the plot in the middle corresponding to the sampling distribution we already generated in the previous animation. What do we notice? Well, for one thing, all the histograms look like a normal distribution with that characteristic bell curve shape. But we can also quite easily notice that the distributions generated from the smaller samples down the bottom are more dispersed or spread out than the one with 500 nurses in each sample up the top.

In the next exercise - it's your turn to create some sampling distributions to test the relationship between sampling distribution and sample size.

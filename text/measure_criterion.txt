The last type of approach we are going to cover on the topic of measurement validity is known as criterion validity. 
---
Criterion validity can be defined as the degree to which a measure of interest relates to a measure of the same construct with previously established validity. 
---
There are two different ways that criterion validity can be evaluated - concurrent and predictive. Let's look at concurrent first.
---
Concurrent validity focuses on the extent to which scores on the instrument can be used to estimate the present or 'concurrent' performance on some other variable or 'criterion' with established validity. A good example of this would be comparing brief depression rating scales with a structured diagnostic interview with a trained psychologist. 
---
Predictive validity differs to this because it involves comparing a score on an instrument with some sort of future event or behaviour. In other words, we want to know if the scores on the instrument can accurately predict some future outcome. For example, if high scores on an instrument that was designed to measure burnout in registered nurse accurately predicted retention rates over a certain follow-up period, that would provide good evidence of the predictive validity of the burnout instrument.

That's all for now.

Studies of interventions are focused on determining whether the intervention has some sort of causal relationship with an outcome of interest. To infer causality, a study must provide evidence that the:
---
explanatory and outcome variables are associated with each other

that the relationship between the explanatory and outcome variable is not able to be explained by another extraneous effect; and

that the cause preceded the effect

The strongest design to test cause and effect relationships in an intervention study is the randomised controlled trial because these types of studies use the concepts of control, manipulation and randomization. Studies that do not use randomization but still apply an intervention are best described simply as a non-randomized study of an intervention. This is in line with the current terminology used by the Cochrane Collaboration, which as you know is a well respected organization revered for it's contribution to evidence-based practice. You may have heard other terms like experimental and quasi-experimental designs, but it's best that we try an move away from that terminology, as it is too ambiguous and can mean different things when used in different contexts.

In the next section, there is a brief overview of different types of quantitative research design that fit into the category of non-randomized studies of interventions. These types of non-randomised studies of interventions manipulate the treatment but either don't have a control group or they don't use randomisation. For this reason, the ability for these studies to determine cause and effect relationships is weakened.

We really shouldn't forget that knowledge translation activities themselves require substantial resources and therefore can be very costly for a health service. The changes in costs mainly arise from the resources needed for the implementation strategy and also due to the changes in service delivery costs in response to the implementation. Because of the potential for substantial budget impacts, it is vital for health service leaders and administrators to determine if the strategies used to improve uptake of evidence into practice are likely to be of good value for their organization.

One of my recent research projects was able to show that a knoweldge translation project aimed at implementing a bundle of interventions in surgical patients to reduce the risk of complications arising from inadvertent perioperative hypothermia was actually good value.
---
Quite an intense and engaging knowledge translation strategy was used. A core team was formed at each site and they led the implementation by: 

accessing email and phone support from the research team when required; 
attending workshops to learn about methods to utilise for local implementation; 
using a structured local barrier identification and mitigation tool (Gurses et al., 2009); and 
using Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles (which were taught at the workshops) to guide the actual implementation. 
---
The effects of the bundle were evaluated using a multi-site pre and post-implementation design. The primary finding was that implementing the bundle into practice resulted in about a 15% increase in use of active warming. So in terms of a knowledge translation strategy, it was deemed effective.
---
To determine if the knowledge translation strategy was not only effective at changing clinician's behaviour but also whether it is good value for other organisations, we conducted a 'probabilistic cost-effectiveess analysis'. What that basically means is that we used simulations to estimate the probabilty that different complications arising from perioperative hypothermia would occur in a hypothetical cohort of surgical patients, based on whether they received active warming or not. We also modelled the costs associated with those complications and the costs associated with the actual knowledge translation strategy.

This plot visualises the results of the study. You'll learn more about cost-effectiveness analyses next semester in 1127, but to just briefly explain, this particular plot is called a cost-effectiveness plane. On the x axis is quality of life, and on the y axis are costs. Each of the dots in this plot is a result from one of the simulations. And we can see quite clearly that the majority of those dots fall in the lower right hand quadrant of the plot, indicating that implementation of the knoweldge translation intervention producedboth cost-savings and improved quality of life. 

So what we can conclude from this study, is that it would be good value for a health care service to allocate the extra resources required for the knowledge 
translation activities aimed at improving use of active warming by clinicians working in perioperative settings.

And finally, we also developed a web application that healthcare leaders and administrators who are responsible to making decisions about resource allocation can use to estimate the probability that implementing this knowledge translation strategy would be cost-effective at their hospital. On the application, the decision-makers first input information specific to their institution. In response, individualised output including a cost-effectiveness plane, incremental net benefit and estimates of the differences in costs and quality-adjusted life years between decisions to either adopt or not adopt the knowledge translation strategy is produced to assist their decision making. In the next section is a working version of the app if you want to try it out.

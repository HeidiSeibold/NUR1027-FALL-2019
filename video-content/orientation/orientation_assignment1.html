# EBP/KT Framework Critique

In this paper you will critique a framework or model for evidence-based nursing practice or knowledge translation.

*You will provide:*

- an in-depth description of the framework;
- a critical analysis of the framework; and
- a discussion of the frameworkâ€™s relevancy and application to nursing practice.

*Consider these points:*

- Describe framework (purpose, components, process)
- Critically analyze the framework
    - Appropriateness/fit for intended purpose
    - Strengths and limitations in enhancing quality of care/service
- Conclusion
    - Useful? Under what circumstances?

The first assignment for this course is a critique of an evidence based practice or knowledge translation framework. The first two weeks of the course are dedicated to these topics. This is a critical analysis of the framework, so you're looking at such things as the appropriateness or how well the models fits with it's intended purpose whether that be promoting evidence based practice in general or a more focused framework geared towards moving knowledge into practice. Be sure to address the strengths and limitations of the model and draw your conclusions about what circumstances the model would be most effectice. Please head over to the assignment tab in Quercus for more information about the requirements for structuring the assignment as well as the marking criteria. You may also find the example of a past assignment useful to review.

# Practice Question and Search Strategy 

- Develop a practice question that can be answered with empirical literature, and locate relevant literature:
    - Background with rationale for conducting search
    - Structured search question
    - Identify relevant search terms

- Search 2 databases
    - Describe search process (attach copy of search history)

- Conclusion
    - what did you find?

The second assignment for this course is a practice questions and search strategy. You'll need to develop a practice question, this could be a clinical or administrative focus, that can be answered with published research studies. You'll then need to locate relevant research literature in order to address that question. Components of the assignment should include the background and rationale for conducting the search, a structured search question, and identification of appropriate search terms. Two databases are required to be searched and we expect a description of the search process as well as an attachment of the search history in an appendix that does not contribute toward the word count for the assignment. A conclusion with a summary of how well the search strategy performed in identifying relevant literature will also be required. Again, please head over to the Assignments section of the quercus page for more details, and pay particular attention to the rubric which outlines how your work will be assessed. There is also a sample assignment from a previous student so that you can get a sense of the content and structure of the assignment.

# Analysis of a Research Report 
.pull-left[
The paper will comprise three components including:

- Study Overview
    - Aims
    - Methods
    - Findings
- Analysis of philosophical underpinnings
    - Key elements characterizing the philosophical paradigm that guided the study
- Analysis of research methods

The third assignment for this course requires you to analyse a research report. For this assignment you'll select one of two research papers that I will provide for you and then you will analyze that study. The analysis will comprise three components. First, we want you to provide a summary of the study including the research aims, the methods that were used and the key study findings. Then in the next component I want you to analyze the key elements characterizing the philosophical paradigm that guided the study. In week 5, I'll be teaching you about the concepts of ontology, epistemology and methodology that will help you to undertake this analysis. The final component should be a detailed analysis of the research methods used in the study. In Weeks 6 through to the end of the course we will cover the content you need to be able to identify strengths and weaknesses of different types of quantitative and qualitative research designs. Be sure to review the information in the assignments tab about this paper in detail. There is an example paper provided. However, you need to note that the structure of this assignment has changed from last year. Previously the assignment entirely focused around the philiosophical paradigm informed the study design. This forms only one component for the assignment now. More detail of course is in the assignment rubric about how this paper will be marked. I strongly advise you check that out. And of course feel free to ask me any questions you may have about the assessment.

This is the course home page. Here, you'll find important information including any announcements I may make, the syllabus, information about the assignments and how to submit them, as well as the weekly learning content and the dicussion board. First, let's take a look at the Weekly learning content tab. Clicking on this tab will take you to a navigation page where you will need to go each week to access the teaching material for the course. The first important thing I want to highlight is that although you can see each week here, please try not to work too far ahead in time. It's best not to consider any of the content as final untill the start of the week, which is each Tuesday morning.

Let's go into week 1 now, because there are some other things I want to show you about how this page is set up. Each week there are a number of chapters of content to work through. Some will have videos with slides, some will have reading, and some will have interactive components to assist your learning. There is an option to mark each chapter as completed before moving on to the next so that you can keep track of where you are up to. I just want to highlight that this isn't compulsory. This is not a way for me to keep track of how many chapters you have completed. It is simply a feature enabled through the web browser that you are viewing the page in. If you view the page from different web browsers at different times, or say for example from both your mobile device and computer, the markers of completed chapters won't be synced together.

One feature in here that I think is pretty cool and that I want to orientate you to now, is an interactive component that is included in some of the weeks. In week 4 of the course, you will come across a screen like this. This interactive component links the webpage to a virtual machine running a program that will allow us to externally run some analyses that I think will help you to understand some of the concepts we introduce about research design and statistical analysis. Because it has to link in to a virtual machine on a server, the first block of code we run may take a minute or two to load while it spins up the server. If you think it has become unresponsive or you get an error message, simply refreshing the webpage and navigating back into the exercise and pressing submit again should fix the problem. In fact, that is good general advice about this quercus page in general - any problems - refreshing the webpage should be your go to move for trouble shooting. Next up I'll talk a bit about the Discussion board and the expectations around your participation in the interactive group learning.

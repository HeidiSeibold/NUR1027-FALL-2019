# Introduction

???

Understanding that there are different types of variables is important because there are different types of things we can do with each in terms of statistical analysis.

For example, a nominal variable only allows us to do certain things. It only allows us to say, are two entitites equal or not equal. For example, if I take two students at random, I can ask are they from the same country or a different country. If I only have a nominal variable, I can't say anything about greater than or less than. As we go down the list from nominal to ordinal to interval to ratio, you'll see that you're able to ask more and more questions. So, for ordinal, I can ask not only was the ranking the same or different between two people, but I can also asked was one person ranked higher or lower than the other. So we can determine, for example, if one basketball team is ranked higher in the league table than another. When we get to the interval level of measurement, we can ask by HOW MUCH do measurements differ. If I only have the rank ordering from the league table but not the cumulative points from the season so far, then I can't ask how much further ahead is the team at the top of the table compared to the team currently ranked second. That's what interval and ratio level of measurements allow us to ask. These types of variables are the richest in terms of information.

# Types of variables in RCT

--

- Does high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) improve ventilation during sedation?

--

- Intervention variable (HFNO vs control) is *nominal*
--

- Outcome variable (Peak transcutaneous carbon dioxide concentration)

???

To bring this back together, let's consider a research example from my own work. At the moment, I'm conducting a randomized controlled trial to answer the question, does High Flow Nasal Oxygen improve ventilation during procedural sedation? The intervention variable is a nominal variable. It's a measurement as to whether the participant was randomized to high flow nasal oxygen or standard care. 

Because we want to know if this way of delivering oxygen improves ventilation, the outcome variable is the peak transcutaneous carbon dioxide concentration. So the level of measurement for the outcome variable is ratio because each interval between measurements is equal and because it has a true zero value - a co2 measurement of zero indicates the absence of carbon dioxide.

# The special case of ordinal variables

- Secondary outcome is 'comfort with oxygen device'

???

Ordinal variables are a somewhat special case when it comes to statistical analysis. Consider one of the secondary outcomes in the high flow nasal oxygen randomized trial example. We want to measure participants perceptions about how comfortable they were receiving oxygen. 

To measure this outcome, we'll be asking them to rate their comfort using a scale that ranges from maximal discomfort to maximal comfort. This is an ordinal scale because although it is rank ordered, we don't know for sure that the intervals between ranks are equal. But by taking the average of these rankings, that will look more like treating this outcome as an interval or ratio variable. So just know that in most cases this is an acceptable way to analyse data measured on an ordinal scale.

The exercise in the next section will demonstrate what is statistical analyses are possible depending on how the level of measurement is defined for a variable.

The knowledge to action framework was built upon some commonalities across other knowledge translation frameworks and it emphasises the iterative, dynamic aspects of the process of moving from generation of new knowledge from research to action. The framework as a whole comprises two related cycles. At its core, is the knowledge creation cycle.  Then there is the knowledge application cycle forms the outer circle of the diagram. The boundaries between these two cycles are fluid, highlighting to fact that each cycle can influence the other at any stage. It also emphasises that effective knowledge translation requires engagement of multiple stakeholders, and in particular involvement of the end users of the knowledge product at each of the stages is a major focus of this framework.

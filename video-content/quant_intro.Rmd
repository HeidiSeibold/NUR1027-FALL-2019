# What makes a study 'quantitative'?

???

In simplistic terms, there is an easy way to determine if a research study is quantitative. Quantitative research measures something, and will include numbers. You can even quite easily distinguish between quantitative and qualitative research designs by the words that are used. Quantitative studies use terms like ‘measure’, ‘test’ and ‘calculate’; while qualitative research uses words like ‘explore’, ‘describe’ and ‘in-depth’. Some make the mistake of thinking that any research which includes a social component is qualitative. For example, surveys of psychosocial aspects of health have been described as qualitative; but this is really not correct, because anything using a survey counts or measures something and so, by definition, it is - quantitative.

AIn quantitative research, it is the question that drives all aspects of the study, and this is what will determine which partiuclar type of quantiative method is required. Quantitative research usually has a hypothesis which is derived from the research question, and this is tested by studying the effects of one or more ‘predictor’ variables on the ‘outcome’ of interest using inferential statistical methods. Inferential statistics are used when you want to make conclusions about a population from data that you have collected from just a sample of that population.

# Different terminology with same meaning

## outcome ~ predictors

## dependent variable ~ independent variables

???

It's important to keep in mind that some texts and other sources use the terms 'dependent' variable as a synonym for the 'outcome' and 'independent' variable as a synonym for the 'predictors'. Personally, I prefer to use the terms predictors and outcomes.

# Epistemology

???

Generally, quantitative approaches to research are based in a positivist or post-positivist paradigm in that it is inherently believed by the researchers that reality is objective and is separate from the researcher themselves. Within this paradigm knowledge is deemed as testable, so the goal of quantitative approaches to research are measurement, explanation and prediction. Methods used to accomplish these goals focus on systematic and objective approaches. With that in mind, quantitative studies are appropriate for answering questions related to:

# Up next

???

The next section provides an overview of major quantitative designs. I like to think about quantitative designs as belonging to one of two broad categories. It can either be an observational study, where the researchers do not attempt to manipulate the conditions or events, or it can be an intervention study, where the researchers have made some manipulations and then want to measure the effect of those changes. Each category includes a range of design choices. Let's begin to take a closer look now at observational studies.

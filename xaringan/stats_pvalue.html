In the last video, we constructed a null distribution to help us test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in leadership score between nurses who do or do not have a masters degree.

## # A tibble: 1 x 1

## # A tibble: 1 x 6

What we can do now, is go ahead and calculate the p-value. The p-value is the probability that we would observe a result either as or more extreme than we got from our sample, assuming the null hypothsis was true. So in our sample the difference in mean leadership scores between groups was one point eight. Let's add that in to the plot as the red line.

```
## mapping: xintercept = ~xintercept 
## geom_vline: na.rm = FALSE
## stat_identity: na.rm = FALSE
## position_identity
```


???

Now all we have to do to get the p-value is work out how many times out of the 1000 random shuffles that made up the null distribution was the difference in means more extreme than one point eight. Something to note here is that because we didn't specify a direction for our alternative hypothesis, we just simply stated that the difference in means between nurses with and without a masters degree would not be zero, the p-value takes into consideration values that were more extreme than what we observed from both sides of the curve - so both positive one point eight and negative one point eight points. Let's shade this area on the null distribution now.

As it turns out, in only 22 out of the 1000 random shuffles that made up the null distribution did the difference in means turn out to be more extreme than the one point eight we observed in our sample.

This equates to a p-value of point zero two two or a two point two percent probability of observing such an extreme event assuming the null hypothesis was true.

### The "goal" is to disprove the null hypothesis. 

???

But what can we conclude from this p-value. Remember back to earlier in this video when we established that the GOAL of hypothesis testing for statistical inference was to disprove the null hypothesis. I'm sure you would have all seen or heard p-values lower than the traditional benchmark of point zero five as being statistically significant. So what we have done by calculating this p-value is we have established some pretty compelling evidence against the null hypothesis. That there was only about a one percent probability of observing a result as or more extreme than the one point eight difference in mean score between groups in our sample strongly suggests that the null hypothesis is not true. In statistical terms, we would say that based on these results, we should therefore REJECT the null hypothesis that there was no difference in leadership scores between groups.

As I'm sure you've heard, p-values are a bit notorious for being misinterpreted. So I hope this series of videos and taking you through the process of simulating a null distribution and comparing that to our observed data has helped you to understand exactly what a p-value is testing. In the next section I've set up an exercise for you to practice setting null and alternative hypotheses and building a null distribution to test the null hypothesis.

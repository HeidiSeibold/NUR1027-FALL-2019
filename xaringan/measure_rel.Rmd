## Iowa satisfaction with anesthesia scale

<img src="isas.png">

???

You would have seen a survey like this before. This is an example of an indirect measurement instrument, asking patients to rate their satisfaction with anesthesia. The survey consists of a number of items (show here on the left), and the respondents rate each of them on a scale from disagree very much to agree very much. You'll recall that this level of measurement could be called ordinal because the level of agreement with the statements are in a rank order.  When using indrect measurements such as this in quantitative research, we need to check that measurements are reliable and valid. Let's start to take an in-depth look at reliability first.

# Measurement reliability

???

If a measurement is reliable, it means that we can reproduce what we are measuring. One type of reliability is known as equivalence. Ideally, two researchers using the same instrument to take a measurement for the same person at the same time should get the same score. The formal term for this is inter-rater reliability.

In the next exercises I'll walk you through with examples to demonstrate some important points about inter-rater reliability.

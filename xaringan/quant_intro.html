The objectives of this module are:

To review quantitative research designs &amp; sampling 
To understand the epistemological grounding of quantitative research approaches 
To relate epistemology to assumptions about rigour and quality in quantitative research; and
To understand and apply criteria for assessing rigour in quantitative studies.

In simplistic terms, there is an easy way to determine if a research study is quantitative. Quantitative research measures something, and will include numbers. You can even quite easily distinguish between quantitative and qualitative research designs by the words that are used. Quantitative studies use terms like ‘measure’, ‘test’ and ‘calculate’; while qualitative research uses words like ‘explore’, ‘describe’ and ‘in-depth’. Some make the mistake of thinking that any research which includes a social component is qualitative. For example, surveys of psychosocial aspects of health have been described as qualitative; but this is really not correct, because anything using a survey counts or measures something and so, by definition, it is - quantitative.

As with all research, it is the  question that drives all aspects of the study, and indeed will determine which method is required. Quantitative research usually has a hypothesis which is derived from the research question, and this is tested by studying the effects of ‘predictor’ variables on an ‘outcome’ using inferential statistical methods. Some texts and other sources use the terms 'dependent' variable as a synonym for the 'predictor' and 'independent' variable as a synonym for the 'outcome'. Personally, I prefer to use the terms predictors and outcomes.

# Epistemology

???

Generally, quantitative approaches to research are based in a positivist or post-positivist paradigm in that it is inherently believed by the researchers that reality is objective and is separate from the researcher themselves. Considering within this paradigm that knowledge is deemed as testable, the goal of quantitative approaches to research are measurement, explanation and prediction. Methods used to accomplish these goals focus on systematic and objective approaches.

&lt;h2&gt;
Quantification and measurement

Relationships among “variables”

Comparisons among groups

Cause and effect relationships
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

With that in mind, quantitative studies are appropriate for answering questions related to:

Quantification and measurement
Relationships among “variables”
Comparisons among groups; and
studies to determine Cause and effect relationships

The next section provides an overview of major quantitative designs. I like to think about quantitative designs as being either an observational study, where the researchers do not attempt to manipulate the conditions or events, or as an intervention study, which can either be randomized or  non-randomised. Each category includes a range of design choices. Let's begin to take a closer look at these.

# Introduction

???

In this lesson, I'm going to teach you about levels of measurement. In statistics, it's common to classify measurements into one of 4 distinct types of variables.

# Types of variables

- Nominal

- Ordinal

- Interval

- Ratio

???

The four kinds are nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. Let's start with the simplest type of variable - the nominal variable.

# Nominal

--

- used to assign individual cases to categories

--

- *country* is a nominal variable

???

A nominal variable literally means to name the instances of a variable. It's used to assign individual cases to categories. So for example, the students enrolled in this course likely come from different countries around the world. So 'country' is a nominal variable. It's just assigning individuals to categories, but it does provide a way to distinguish some students from others.

# Ordinal variable

- Used to rank order cases

--

- Countries may be ranked according to their overall size (population)

???

The next type of variable is an ordinal variable. These are used to rank order cases in a dataset. So if we think about the country example, we might instead rank countries according to their overall size in terms of population. To place a rank order for this variable, the country with the population would be assigned the number 1, the next largest would be assigned the number 2 and so on. Then, country would be an ordinal variable.

# Interval

- Used to rank order cases where the distance, or *interval*, between each value is *equal*

--

- Each country has a *longitude* and a *latitude*

???
For interval variables, the distance between categories is equal. So again, sticking with the example of countries of origin, and if we take a look at the globe, each country has a longidue and a latitude, so I can compare these measurements between each country. The distance from say 0 degrees to 100 degrees longitude is the same as the distance from 100 degrees to 200 degrees longitude. They are equal intervals. In other words - they're equal spaces. So longitude and latitude are interval variables.

# Ratio

- Same as interval but with a true zero-point

???

The fourth type of variable is a ratio variable. Ratio variables are just like interval variables, with the exception that they have a true zero point. But what does that mean? Let's consider population as an example. When I talked ealier about ordinal variables and ranked countries all we did was assign the number 1 to the largest population, a 2 to the next largest and so on. I wasn't talking about the actual population. The actual population is a ratio variable. And it's a ratio variable because it has a zero point. So if the population of country is zero - that's meaningful it's a true zero.
